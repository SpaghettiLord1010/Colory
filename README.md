# Colory
Color-Memory that gives a score of how close you were to the right color!

This was suggested Catherine from You're Perfect Studios - Pay them a visit here and get some wonderful art: https://www.youreperfect.studio/

Very simple html-php project that shows you a color for a bit and then you need to select a color you think looks just like the one you just saw, it is great for improving your color memory!

You can test it right here in the browser: https://spaghettilord1010.com/colory/
